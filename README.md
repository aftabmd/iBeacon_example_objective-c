# beacon_example_objective-c
Example of detecting an iBeacon region in iOS using Objective-C.
A simple example of detecting a single beacon region using Objective-C.
When in the foreground a list of detected beacons with the appropropriate Proxmimity UUID are shown in a Table View. 
If the app is in the background then notifications are issued everytime the proximity to the beacon changes, and if you enter/exit a region. This example uses the iOS CoreLocation Framework and requires no thrid party frameworks.
